# Phase 2: Resume Parser - BERT-based NLP System

## 🎯 Phase 2 Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **BERT-based Resume Parsing**: Implement NLP models for intelligent text extraction
2. **Skill Extraction & Categorization**: Identify and categorize technical skills with confidence scores
3. **Experience & Education Parsing**: Extract work history and educational background
4. **Resume Quality Assessment**: Analyze completeness and provide improvement suggestions
5. **API Endpoints**: Create REST endpoints for resume upload and processing

### Technical Requirements
- **BERT/Transformers**: For advanced NLP processing
- **spaCy**: For named entity recognition and text processing
- **PDF/DOCX Parsing**: For document format support
- **Async Processing**: For handling large files efficiently
- **Progress Tracking**: For user feedback during processing

## 🏗️ Architecture Plan

### Core Components
```
app/models/ai/
├── resume_parser.py      # Main resume parsing orchestrator
├── text_extractor.py     # Document text extraction
├── skill_extractor.py    # Skill identification and categorization
├── experience_parser.py  # Work experience extraction
├── education_parser.py   # Education information extraction
└── quality_assessor.py   # Resume quality scoring
```

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/v1/resumes/upload     # Upload and parse resume
GET  /api/v1/resumes/{id}       # Get parsed resume data
GET  /api/v1/resumes/{id}/status # Get processing status
POST /api/v1/resumes/{id}/skills # Extract skills only
```

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Document Text Extraction
- PDF parsing with PyPDF2/pdfplumber
- DOCX parsing with python-docx
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Layout preservation for structured data

### Step 2: BERT-based NLP Pipeline
- Fine-tuned BERT models for resume sections
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) for key information
- Sequence classification for section identification
- Token classification for skill extraction

### Step 3: Skill Extraction System
- Technical skill identification
- Skill categorization (programming, tools, soft skills)
- Confidence scoring for each skill
- Years of experience estimation

### Step 4: Experience & Education Parsing
- Work history extraction with dates and roles
- Company and location identification
- Achievement and responsibility parsing
- Education details with degrees and institutions

### Step 5: Quality Assessment
- Completeness scoring
- Format and structure analysis
- Improvement suggestions
- ATS compatibility checking

### Step 6: API Integration
- Async processing endpoints
- Progress tracking
- Error handling and validation
- Response formatting
